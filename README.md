# Dart Null Safety Gotcha: Unexpected Null-Aware Operator Behavior

This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Dart when using the null-aware operator (`??`) without adequately handling null values. It highlights the difference between a simple null check and relying solely on the null-aware operator's default value assignment.

The `bug.dart` file showcases code where `_myVariable` might be null, leading to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.

The `bugSolution.dart` file presents the solution by explicitly checking for null before using `_myVariable` or using the null-aware operator correctly.
